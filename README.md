# üê¢ ethereum-validators-monitoring (aka balval)

Consensus layer validators monitoring bot, that fetches Lido or Custom Users Node Operators keys
from Execution layer and checks their performance in Consensus
layer by: balance delta, attestations, proposes, sync committee participation.

Bot has two separate working modes: `finalized` and `head` for fetching validator info,
writes data to **Clickhouse**, displays aggregates by **Grafana**
dashboard, alerts about bad performance by **Prometheus + Alertmanger** and
routes notifications to Discord channel via **alertmanager-discord**.

## Working modes

You can switch working mode by providing `WORKING_MODE` environment variable with one of the following values:

### `finalized`
Default working mode. The service will fetch validators info from finalized states (the latest finalized epoch is 2 epochs back from `head`).
It is more stable and reliable because all data is already finalized.

**Pros**:
* No errors due to reorgs
* Less rewards calculation errors
* Accurate data in alerts and dashboard

**Cons**:
* 2 epochs delay in processing and critical alerts will be given with 2 epochs delay
* In case of long finality the app will not monitor and will wait for the finality

### `head`
Alternative working mode. The service will fetch validators info from non-finalized states.
It is less stable and reliable because of data is not finalized yet. There can be some calculation errors because of reorgs.

**Pros**:
* Less delay in processing and critical alerts will be given with less delay
* In case of long finality the app will monitor and will not wait for the finality

**Cons**:
* Errors due to reorgs
* More rewards calculation errors
* Possible inaccurate data in alerts and dashboard

## Dashboards

There are three dashboards in Grafana:
* **Validators** - shows aggregated data about performance for all monitored validators
![Validators](.images/validators-dashboard.png)
* **NodeOperator** - shows aggregated data about performance for each monitored node operator
![NodeOperators](.images/nodeoperators-dashboard.png)
* **Rewards & Penalties** - shows aggregated data about rewards, penalties, and missed rewards for each monitored node operator
![Rewards & Penalties](.images/rewards-penalties-dashboard.png)

## Alerts

There are several default alerts which are triggered by Prometheus rules:

* General:
  * üî™ Slashed validators
  * üí∏ Operators with negative balance delta
* Proposals:
  * üì• Operators with missed block propose
  * üìàüì• Operators with missed block propose (on possible high reward validators)
* Sync:
  * üîÑ Operators with bad sync participation
  * üìàüîÑ Operators with bad sync participation (on possible high reward validators)
* Attestations:
  * üìù‚ùå Operators with missed attestation
  * üìùüê¢ Operators with high inc. delay attestation
  * üìùüè∑Ô∏è Operators with two invalid attestation property (head/target/source)
  * üìàüìù‚ùå Operators with missed attestation (on possible high reward validators)

## First run

You have two options to run this application: `docker-compose` or `node`
and two sources of validator list: `lido` (by default) or `file` (see [here](#use-custom-validators-list)).

Because Lido contract on `mainnet` contains a lot of validators,
fetching and saving them to local storage can take time (depends on EL RPC host) and a lot of RAM.
For avoiding `heap out of memory` error, you can pass `NODE_OPTIONS` env var with `--max-old-space-size=8192` value
and when the application completes its first cycle, you can restart your instance without this env variable.

## Run via docker-compose

1. Use `.env.example.compose` file content to create your own `.env` file
2. Build app image via `docker-compose build app`
3. Set owner for validators registry sources
```bash
chown -R 1000:1000 ./docker/validators
```
4. Create `.volumes` directory from `docker` directory:
```bash
cp -r docker .volumes
chown -R 65534:65534 .volumes/prometheus
chown -R 65534:65534 .volumes/alertmanager
chown -R 472:472 .volumes/grafana
```
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
6. Open Grafana UI at `http://localhost:8082/`
   (login: `admin`, password: `MYPASSWORT`) and wait
   first app cycle execution for display data

## Run via node

1. Install dependencies via `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn build`
3. Tweak `.env` file from `.env.example.local`
4. Run Clickhouse to use as bot DB
```bash
docker-compose up -d clickhouse
```
5. Set owner for validators registry sources
```bash
chown -R 1000:1000 ./docker/validators
```
6. Run `yarn start:prod`

## Use custom validators list

By default, monitoring bot fetches validator keys from Lido contract, but you can monitor your own validators:
1. Set `VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_SOURCE` env var to `file`
2. Create file with keys by example [here](docker/validators/custom_mainnet.yaml)
3. Set `VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_FILE_SOURCE_PATH` env var to `<path to your file>`

If you want to implement your own source, it must match [RegistrySource interface](src/validators-registry/registry-source.interface.ts) and be included in [RegistryModule providers](src/validators-registry/registry.module.ts)

## Clickhouse data retention

By default, storage keep the data with `Inf.` time to live.
It can be changed by the TTL policy for Clickhouse:
```
# Mainnet
ALTER TABLE validators_summary MODIFY TTL toDateTime(1606824023 + (epoch * 32 * 12)) + INTERVAL 3 MONTH;

# Holesky
ALTER TABLE validators_summary MODIFY TTL toDateTime(1695902400 + (epoch * 32 * 12)) + INTERVAL 3 MONTH;

# Goerli
ALTER TABLE validators_summary MODIFY TTL toDateTime(1616508000 + (epoch * 32 * 12)) + INTERVAL 3 MONTH;
```

## Application critical alerts (via Alertmanager)

In addition to alerts based on Prometheus metrics you can receive special critical alerts based on beaconchain aggregates from app.

You should pass env var `CRITICAL_ALERTS_ALERTMANAGER_URL=http://<alertmanager_host>:<alertmanager_port>`.

And if `ethereum_validators_monitoring_data_actuality < 1h` it allows you to receive alerts from table bellow

| Alert name                 | Description                                                                                                                       | If fired repeat | If value increased repeat |

| CriticalNegativeDelta      | More than 1/3 or more than 1000 Node Operator validators with negative balance delta (between current and 6 epochs ago)           | every 6h        | every 1h                  |
| CriticalMissedAttestations | More than 1/3 or more than 1000 Node Operator validators with missed attestations in the last {{ BAD_ATTESTATION_EPOCHS }} epochs | every 6h        | every 1h                  |

## Release flow

To create new release:

1. Merge all changes to the `master` branch
1. Navigate to Repo => Actions
1. Run action "Prepare release" action against `master` branch
1. When action execution is finished, navigate to Repo => Pull requests
1. Find pull request named "chore(release): X.X.X" review and merge it with "Rebase and merge" (or "Squash and merge")
1. After merge release action will be triggered automatically
1. Navigate to Repo => Actions and see last actions logs for further details
